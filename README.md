# My Anki Decks of Flashcards
Decks of Anki flashcards shared publicly from my side.

The cards have been created to apply *active learning* and *spaced repetition* techniques offered through [Anki]([https://apps.ankiweb.net/](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)) to comprehend various topics. 

I've explained my way of using flashcards thoroughly in [this blog post](https://pawelcislo.com/2020/07/10/optimising-our-learning-retention-rate-with-srs-anki/), where I also listed all the [cards](https://pawelcislo.com/2020/07/10/optimising-our-learning-retention-rate-with-srs-anki/#ftoc-heading-11) and [plugins](https://pawelcislo.com/2020/07/10/optimising-our-learning-retention-rate-with-srs-anki/#ftoc-heading-12) that I'm currently using.
